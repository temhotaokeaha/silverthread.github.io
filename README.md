## What is this project?
Visual Novel kind of game about a world with slightly different development route for the internet and computers. It’s made as HTML page to be played in a browser. It will/should be accessible via GitHub Pages.

## State of the project
This is a pre-alpha version. On technical side, the code is SHIT, especially the data storage. Fixes, improvements and contributions are welcomed. On artistic side, the design is in many places too generic and/or unpolished.

Rough dev cycle - if it ever gets to it - is as follows:

**Alpha**:
- focus on prototyping;
- placeholders (text, pics, sounds);
- 1 ending;
- plot only;

**Beta**:
- normalized UI;
- typing gameplay;
- 3-4 endings;

**Release**:
- sound effects, maybe music
- coherent plot;
- polished typing gameplay;
